"""
Orchestrator Agents Package - System Coordination for Both Phases

This subpackage contains the orchestrator agents that act as conductors for the entire AI system.
Think of orchestrators like the conductors of an orchestra - they don't play instruments themselves,
but they coordinate all the musicians (other agents) to create beautiful music (intelligent responses).

The orchestrators understand the big picture of how different agents need to work together,
when to call each agent, how to pass information between them, and how to handle situations
when things don't go as planned. They're the brain that coordinates the entire system.

We have two main orchestrators:
- ConversationOrchestrator: Manages real-time user conversations (Phase 2)
- PreprocessingOrchestrator: Manages video processing pipeline (Phase 1)
